This program will allow you to edit Steam category names quickly and easily. There are a few steps you need to do before this will work:

1. Enter your categories in categories.txt. One category per line. Make sure they're typed exactly as they appear in Steam (case sensitive). (This may not be neccesary in the future)

2. Enter the path of your sharedconfig.vdf file. On Windows, it's located in C:\Program Files\Steam\userdata\[Steam User ID]\7\remote\sharedconfig.vdf by default. This is highly recommended, and is a must if you use a custom Steam directory or a non-Windows machine, but the program may be able to find your path automatically if you use the default path on Windows. You can enter 't' on the main menu to find out if your path is detected and working. If the path is shown, that means it works.

3. Backing up your sharedconfig.vdf file is strongly recommended. I will not take responsibility for any lost or corrupt files.

4. Exit Steam before running.

This is only tested on Windows, but might still work on other operating systems as long as step 2 is done correctly.

Known Bugs:

This does not work with non-Steam games. They will remain in the original category and will have to be moved manually.
